# Shell Shenanigans
This repository holds a slowly growing list of commands, some of the results of
me playing around with Posix shell and/or Bash. Some are actually useful (and I
do actually use them), others less so. Some are Debian-specific. Some of them
are based on my posts in the German [debianforum.de](https://debianforum.de/).
